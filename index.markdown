# Machine Learning Interview Questions

This repository aims to develop and compile a list of questions focussed on machine learning interviews for various data science roles, to help prepare candidates for the same. Each question and its solution is critically reviewed and is structured with metadata tags to help sort and identify questions based on topics, difficuty etc.


We welcome community contributions, feel free to add your own question and solution to improve the question bank. Adding new questions isn't the only way to contribute, small improvements or fixes in the questions/solutions existing already are always appreciated. You can also help review pull requests, triage issues and suggest more features. If youâ€™re unsure where to start, have a look at our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/DevPranjal/ML-InterviewQs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details or reach out at dsg@iitr.ac.in.
